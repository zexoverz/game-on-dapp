## Holesky Network
The Holesky testnet will be replacing the Goerli testnet. It is planned to be the new testing environment for protocol developments, infrastructures, and developments related to consensus staking. Alongside Sepolia, Holesky will become the primary testing environment for developers on Ethereum.

## Smart Contract
I build Token Staking contract designed to facilitate token staking for a specified duration. Users can stake their tokens, earn rewards based on the staking duration and APY (Annual Percentage Yield), and later withdraw their staked tokens along with the earned rewards.

I have my own ERC20 named "ZexoToken" The contract interacts with an ERC-20 token contract "ZexoToken" allowing users to stake and claim rewards using these tokens. includes functionality for transferring tokens, checking balances, and storing information about token holders.
